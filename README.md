This is my collection of wallpapers taken from various sources (but mainly Wallhaven and Unsplash) that will be updatedin the future. Strictly for personal use, nothing in this repo is owned by me or affiliated with me in any way. If you're the creator of a picture and you want it removed or credited, contact me. Enjoy!

## **Some rules I follow here:**
-  **Strictly 1440p or above.** Extreme compression isn't tolerated either. If there's a picture that did not originally exist in 1440p+, it means I upscaled it. Don't worry about the quality, I won't upload something that upscales poorly.
-  **Strictly SFW.** Self-explanatory.
-  **Tagging.** To simplify searching, every wallpaper here will have its category specified in the title.

 ### **Categories:**
 - **Abstract:** Self-explanatory.
 - **Monochrome:** Black-and-white of any variety.
 - **Anime:** Anything taken from an anime or drawn in an anime-resembling style.
 - **Illustration:** Artworks or renders that don't fit abstract or anime criteria.
 - **Pixel:** Artworks or renders in a pixel-art style.
 - **Urban:** Anything taken in real life within a distinct urban environment.
 - **Nature:** Anything taken in real life with nature in the focus.

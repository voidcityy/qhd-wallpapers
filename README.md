This is my collection of wallpapers that will get updates in the future. It'll also be offered by my swayFX install script. Enjoy!
 </h3>

**Note:** None of these pictures were made by me, and they're here strictly for personal use. If you're a creator and you want your picture credited or removed, contact me.   

### **Some rules I follow here:**
-  **Strictly 1440p or above.** Extreme compression isn't tolerated either. If there's a picture that did not originally exist in 1440p+, it means I upscaled it. Don't worry about the quality, I won't upload something that upscales poorly.
-  **Strictly SFW.** Self-explanatory.
-  **Tagging.** To simplify searching, every wallpaper here will have its category specified in the title.

 ### **Categories:**
 - **Abstract:** Self-explanatory.
 - **Monochrome:** Black-and-white of any variety.
 - **Anime:** Anything taken from an anime or drawn in an anime-resembling style.
 - **Illustration:** Artworks or renders that don't fit abstract or anime criteria.
 - **Pixel:** Artworks or renders in a pixel-art style.
 - **Urban:** Anything taken in real life within a distinct urban environment.
 - **Nature:** Anything taken in real life with nature in the focus.
